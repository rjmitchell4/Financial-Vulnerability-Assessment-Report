# Financial-Vulnerability-Assesment-Report
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a vulnerability assessment report for our fictitious client Artemis Financial. The company wished to implement and apply the most current and effective software security for its RESTful web application API and sought our expertise in taking steps to protect the organization. We had to examine the web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities in their software and create a assessment report for mitigating those security vulnerabilities.
