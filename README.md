# Financial-Vulnerability-Assesment-Report
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a vulernability assessment report for our fictitious client Artemis Financial. The company wished to implement and apply the most current and effective software security for its RESTful web application API and sought our expertise in taking steps to protect the organization. We had to examine the web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities in their software and create a assessment report for mitigating those security vulnerabilities.

What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
