# Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assesment Report // A report evaluating security, potential risks, and avenues of mitigation 
For this assignment, we were tasked with creating a vulnerability assessment report for our fictitious client Artemis Financial. The company wished to implement and apply the most current and effective software security for its RESTful web application API and sought our expertise in taking steps to protect the organization. We had to examine the web-based software application to identify any security vulnerabilities in their software and create a assessment report for mitigating those security vulnerabilities.
Included in the report are sections discussing the results of manual code review as well as static testing via Maven. Manually reviewing allowed me to identify key issues in coding practices or the flow of logic, while using the Maven plugin allowed me to directly evaluate every included package and compile all the pre-determined deficiencies that are published. 
Included within the sections are discussions about approaching the vulnerabilities with varying levels of consideration based on the level of threat. Mitigation and security are both best applied in a system that encourages security testing as part of the whole DevOps pipeline (DevSecOps).
